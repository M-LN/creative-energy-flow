## 4. **Detailed Features**

### 4.1. **Energy Dashboard**
- View current energy and social battery as large, clear numbers or gauges.
- Show trend graphs for the day/week/month.
- Display quick stats: average, highest, lowest, and last logged value.

### 4.2. **Energy Input**
- Interactive slider (1–10) to log current creative energy.
- Optional text field for notes (“What’s affecting your energy?”).
- Timestamp is automatically recorded.
- Quick action: “Log Now” button.

### 4.3. **Social Battery Input**
- Similar slider (1–10) for social energy.
- Dropdown or tags for recent activity (e.g., “Meeting”, “Alone Time”).
- Optional notes.
- “Update Social Battery” button.

### 4.4. **Charts & Visualization**
- **Line Chart:** Energy over time (day, week, month).
- **Bar Chart:** Social battery vs. energy correlations.
- **Pie/Donut:** Time spent in each energy zone (high/medium/low).
- Interactive tooltips and legends.
- Responsive for mobile and desktop.

### 4.5. **Offline & PWA Capabilities**
- Fully works offline (cache assets and data).
- Installable on mobile/desktop (manifest, icon, splash).
- Prompt user to “Add to Home Screen”.

### 4.6. **Data Storage**
- All logs stored locally (localStorage or IndexedDB).
- Privacy-first: No cloud sync by default.

### 4.7. **Export/Import**
